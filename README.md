  <em>A lambda calculus dissertation project.</em>

Hello World!

There isn't much to read here at the moment,
this is a project I'm working on idependently for a dissertation that aims to extend the lambda calculus for visual programming.

### References:

Full bibliography coming here as soon as the actual dissertation itself starts being written, in the meantime, here are some resources
